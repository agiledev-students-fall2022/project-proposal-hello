# Project Proposal
# 1. Project Title: 
Tesla Dog
# 2. What and Why: 
  It is an app specifically for Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA)
  We have seen so many different finance apps (Tradingview, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg etc) that shows information about the stock market. Yet there haven't been an app that is specifically targeting one stock. That's why I thought it interesting to make one. 
  Among numerous stocks in the market, I think Tesla could be a good choice (may change if there is a better one). It is a stock with a crazy fandom, price of which influenced by different external factors such as bitcoin and dogecoin price, Elon's tweets and so on. I think it will be cool to make an app in which we can see all kinds of information about Tesla stock in one place.

# 3. For Whom:
This app is for all the stock investors, especially the lovers and haters of Tesla and Elon Musk. 

# 4. How:
I'm considering several features:
- basic info like the price, financial statements, etc. (Can use Yahoo Finance API)
- Elon's tweets
- Bitcoin and Dogecoin price charts
- News related to Tesla and Elon Musk
- Some analyst reports about Tesla (like TroyTeslike on Twitter)
- Open chatroom for the shareholders

And of course I'm open to adding any additional features. 

# 5. Scope:
Although I do not have much experience in software development, I believe the proposal will be appropriate to be done by 4-6 beginner software engineers. 
Especially, the app is a combination of several small features. The team can decide to add and drop some features according to the process during the project.
