# Project Proposal
1. Project Title: How's Your Day?
2. What and Why: 
  It is a daily tracker to monitor your to do list and your spendings. I came out to make this app because I found it necessary to stop wasting so much money and time everyday by tracking them. Also, I found there was no app that offers both to-do list (or scheduling) in a single app. So I would like to make one during this course.

3. For Whom:
This app is primarily for myself. However, I believe that there are many people like me who want to track their own daily activities.

4. How:
The app has two main functions : spending tracker, and scheduling app
First, users can record their spendings with some categories (groceries, food, enterntainment etc.), and they can add some extra notes too. Moreever, users can see how much they spend daily on the calender, and the portions of spendings in each category. 
Second, users can record their daily schedules. They can write their tasks and corresponding time intervals for each tasks. 

5. Scope:
Although I do not have much experience in software development, I believe the proposal will be appropriate to be done by 4-6 beginner software engineers. The biggest challenge will be making the front-end user interface, since it includes lots of works like making a calendar, a pie chart for spendings in different categories, and the time slots for scheduling. However, the backend won't have that much problem as long as entities are structured nicely at the very beginning.
