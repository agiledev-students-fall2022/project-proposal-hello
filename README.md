# Project Proposal
# 1. Project Title: 
Tesla Dog
# 2. What and Why: 
  It is an app specifically for Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA)
  We have seen so many different finance apps (Tradingview, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg etc) that shows information about the stock market. Yet there haven't been an app that is specifically targeting one app. That's why I thought it interesting to make one. 
  Among numerous stocks in the market, I think Tesla could be a good choice. It is the stock with a crazy fandom, influenced by different factors such as bitcoin, Musk's tweets and so on. I think it will be cool to make an app in which we can see most of the information about this stock.

3. For Whom:
This app is for all the stock investors, especially the fans and haters of Tesla and Elon Musk. 

4. How:
I'm considering several features:
- basic info like the price, financial statements, etc. (Can use Yahoo Finance API)
- Musk's tweet's
- BTC and Dogecoin price charts
- News related the Tesla and Elon Musk
- Some analyst reports about Tsla (like TroyTeslike on Twitter)
And of course I'm open to any additional features. 

5. Scope:
Although I do not have much experience in software development, I believe the proposal will be appropriate to be done by 4-6 beginner software engineers. 
Especially, the app is a combination of several different services. The team can decide to add and drop some features according to the performance of the entire semester.
